There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > A Social Social Media Site

## Sub-Heading ##
  > We have one shot every day to make it count, the same goes for our app.

## Summary ##
  > "Social" sites lack real connection and have begun to be filled with garbage. Much of this is due to how they promote posting as much as possible, as often as possible. They focus on quantity. We believe life is about quality.
  >

## Problem ##
  > Social Media isn't social. "Social" companies are focused on driving traffic and generating content. Most of the content generated is a polished fiction of people's lives. True connection is not fostered in fantasies, but grounded and developed in the vulnerabilities and truth of life.

## Solution ##
  > With our site, just like in life, each day comes one at a time, and each day there is just one shot to seize the day.

## Quote from You ##
  > "If you had one shot. One opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment. Would you capture it, or just let it slip?"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is as simple as a few clicks. If you have an email, you're ready to go.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Spending time on sites like Instagram, Facebook, or Snapchat was draining. Everyone was just taking pictures of their food looking for some attention, rather than sharing what was really going on in their lives. Spending time on Once has helped me better understand how common struggles are, and how much hope there is in the world."
